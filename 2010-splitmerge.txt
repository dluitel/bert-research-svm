Introduction  
Purpose
This document details the software requirements specification for the PDF Split and Merge v2. open source project. It will later be used as a base for the extension of the existing software itself. This document follows the IEEE standard for software requirements specification documents.
PDF is the most popular file format for secure, dependable electronic information exchange. It is used by more than half billion people and has become one of the world’s most trusted technologies. PDF files can be viewed from almost any platform (Macintosh®, Windows®, UNIX® and LINUX® as well as numerous mobile platforms and devices) but the manipulation of these files is not usually free.
The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way to handle pdf files efficiently and free through a simple graphical interface.
 Document Conventions
PDF Split and Merge was created prior to this document, so all requirements stated here are already satisfied. It is very important to update this document with every future requirement and clarify its priority for consistency purposes, so that this document can remain useful.
Because of the fact that PDFsam is already implemented, parts of this document have a style similar to a manual document.
Some technical information has been included. Readers can refer to Appendix A at the end of the document for terms definition (glossary).
 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This Software Requirements document is intended for:
 Developers who can review project’s capabilities and more easily understand where their efforts should be targeted to improve or add more features to it (design and code the application – it sets the guidelines for future development).
 Project testers can use this document as a base for their testing strategy as some bugs are easier to find using a requirements document. This way testing becomes more methodically organized.
 End users of this application who wish to read about what this project can do.  Project Scope
PDF Split and Merge is a FOSS tool that can split, merge and manipulate PDF documents. It provides a graphical Interface (GUI) and a shell Interface (Console). It is available in two versions, basic and enhanced, both are open source.

Software Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge   
The GUI provides the user with all the functionality needed to handle a PDF file (or more files together). The functionalities are distributed in plugins. Each plugin performs a specific function and loads in the main GUI.
In the basic version, the GUI contains six plugins:
 Alternate Mix
 Merge/Extract
 Rotate
 Split
 Visual document composer
 Visual reorder

  Overall Description    Product Perspective
PDF Split and Merge is a multi functional tool for manipulating pdf files. It is free and open source with a GNU General Public License (GPL). Although there are many programs for viewing pdfs, there is not any program to handle pdfs with so many features as PDFsam. The fact that it is open source is an extra motive for the users who have the knowledge to help with the project’s development. In addition, there is also an enhanced version of the software that provides even more capabilities.
   Product Features
The basic version provides:
 Splitting pdf documents (into chapters, single pages, etc).
 Merging many pdf documents or subsections of them.
 Extract section from a pdf document in a single pdf document.
 Mix alternate pages taken from two pdf documents in straight or reverse order into a single document.
 Rotate pages of the selected pdf documents.
 Visually reorder pages of a selected pdf document.
 Visually compose a document, dragging pages from selected pdf documents.
 Save and load the working environment, so that recurrent jobs are automated.
 Managing PDFsam settings and setting an environment to load at start up.
Any of those features can be executed as command prompt from the command line Console application.

   User Classes and Characteristics
This project refers to several types of users of any computer system. However, this project is meant to be used by two major user classes:
-General users who can use the software to cover specific needs:
 People of all age groups without much experience because the PDFsam interface is pleasant and user friendly and its functions are relatively simple.
 Users with more experience on computer systems could use some advanced features offered by PDFsam, such as executing its functions in command prompt from the command line application. A command line console could be useful for batch jobs, server jobs (e.g. to manipulate larger pdf files)
  Open source software developers and contributors:
 Software Developers: People with very good knowledge of programming language project, in order to understand and be able to extend project’s source code.
 Translators: People of all age groups with very good knowledge of a language not included in the current translation list.
 Anyone who wants to help FOSS community. The whole project is based on the conception of Free and Open Source Software, so all people are welcome to contribute any way the can/like.
   Operating Environment
PDFsam is platform independent and it runs on every platform where a Java Virtual Machine is available (requires a JVM version  or higher).
It has been tested on:
 Microsoft Windows
 GNU/Linux distributions
 MacOSX
Hardware requirements of the project:
 Maximum memory usage: 254MB* (by default)
 Disk space needed: 13.9MB
*it depends on the size of the pdf files. User can change the default value of memory with the appropriate commands if he has to handle large pdf files.
   Design and Implementation Constraints
PDFsam is platform independent and is written in Java. Its user interface is written with Java Swing, so anyone who wishes to work on further development of PDFsam has to know this programming language.
PDFsam is GNU GPLv  licensed and the PDFsam-console is dual licensed (GPLv  and LGPLv2). Everyone, that does or is going to develop or use PDFsam, should agree and fully accept the terms of this kind of license.

Software Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge 
  System Features
PDFsam consists of a number of plugins which constitute its basic functions, and some additional features that make the whole process easier and faster. All plugins are located in the “plugins tree” on the left side of the GUI Interface.
This section describes the functional requirements of the application and the features it provides. System features are described in detail to help the future extension and testing of the system. Features stated here are already parts of the implemented system so no prioritization is needed. Priority is needed for features to be developed that will be added to this document later.
   System Feature    Split
Split a pdf document through the GUI Interface. This plugin allows you to set a number of options that will be used to split the document.
 3. 3.1.2
Description
The user can divide a pdf document into parts, following some options for how to split the document. Then he can save the output pdf files in a directory he wants.
Stimulus/Response Sequences
The user has to select the Split option from the plugins tree (or press the “S” key) to display the split panel.
 This is a screenshot of the Split plugin

Software Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge
The GUI Split panel consists of the following parts:
 Selection panel: The user selects the document he wants to split from a directory. When the file is imported, some information about the file displayed (such as pages number, pdf version...). If the document is protected the user have to enter the password to the appropriate field and then reload the pdf.
 Split options: The user can choose between   types of splitting:
 Burst: the input file will be split in single pages.
 Split every “n” pages: the input file will be split every “n” pages.
 Split even pages: the input file will be split at every even page.
 Split odd pages: the input file will be split at every odd page.
 Split after these pages: the input file will be split at the given pages numbers.
 Split at this size: the input file will be split in files of the given size (roughly).
 Split by bookmark level: the input file will be split at every   linked by the bookmarks of the selected level (this can be very useful if you want to split an e-book in chapters).
 Destination folder: The user selects the destination folder for the output files (specific or same as source). Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.
 Output options: Here the user can define a pattern that will generate filenames for the output files. The available complex prefixes that can be used are:
 [CURRENTPAGE]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with the current   number. The number of digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of “#” at the prefix name, inside the square brackets (e.g. the prefix [CURRENTPAGE###] will generate prefixes like ‘001’, ‘002’...).
 [TIMESTAMP]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with the current date and time. Time has milliseconds precision and the replaced variable will be something like “20100206_045107232” that is “YYYYMMDD_HHmmssSSS”.
 [FILENUMBER]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with a file number according to the output order. The number of digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of '#' at the prefix name, inside the square brackets (e.g. [FILENUMBER###] will generate prefixes like '001', '002'...). A starting number can be appended at the prefix name inside the square brackets (e.g. [FILENUMBER13] will generate prefixes like '13', '14'...). Finally, it can be combined a started number and the number of digits (e.g. [FILENUMBER###13] will generate prefixes like '013', '014'...).
 [BASENAME]: This prefix variable is replaced with the original name of the input document. It does not ensure unique output filenames and it must be used together with other variables. If it is used alone, the system will use the default filename pattern.
 [BOOKMARK_NAME]: This prefix variable can be used only when splitting by bookmarks level. It ensures unique output filenames (unless two or more bookmarks have the same name) and it enables variable substitution. It's replaced with the bookmark name. Some characters of the bookmark name could be stripped if they are not valid character for a file name.

Software Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge
3.1.3
 If left blank, the output filenames will take the default pattern [CURRENTPAGE] _ [BASENAME].
 It can be written anything before or after of these prefixes.

Stimulus/Response Sequences
The user has to select the Merge/Extract option from the plugins tree (or press the “M” key) to display the merge/extract panel.
The GUI Merge/Extract panel enables the user to select more than one file to handle. Once the user selects the file/files they are automatically inserted into the selection table with some specific details. Now, the user can change the order and/or select the pages of the file/files that he wants to be included in the final document.
In the   Selection column of the table, user can write:
 “All”: to merge the whole document.
 “ page to page”: to merge pages between “page” and “to page” (e.g. 8-1  if he want to merge pages between   and 15).
 “ page -”: to merge pages starting from “page” till the end of the document.
 A single   number, if he wants only that   of the document.
 Commas (without any blanks) to separate the different values (e.g. “2,12-16,17-” if he wants to merge   2, pages between 1  and 16, and all the other pages from page1  to the end).
In the Password column user has to set the password if the document is protected and then reload the file. The user can change the order of the files by using “Move Up” and “Move Down” buttons, or make the list be ordered by the value of a specific column by clicking the header of that column.
The user has the ability to export the list of the selected files as an xml file that can be used as an input file for the console “concat” command, -l option.
If the pdf documents contain forms, the user must add that to the merge options.
Finally, the user selects the output file path or let the PDFsam create one by default to the same folder as one of the imported files. Also, he can select whether he wants the output file to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated document. The user presses the RUN button to start the merging of the files.
Functional Requirements
REQ-1: pages number in the   selection must be comprehended.
REQ-2: The compression of the output files requires pdf version  or above.
3.2.3

The user can change the order of the two files by using “Move Up” and “Move Down” buttons, or make the list be ordered by the value of a specific column by clicking the header of that column.
 Mix options: The user can modify the following parameters:
 Reverse first document: if he wants to take pages from the first document in
 Reverse second document: if he wants to take pages from the second document in reverse order (starting from the last page).
 Number of pages to switch document: the user with this option can define the step size of the mix. The default behavior is to take one   from the first document and one from the second one. However this step can be configured by this option telling PDFsam how many pages it should take from one document before switching to the other.
 Destination output file: The user selects the destination folder for the output files or let the PDFsam create one by default to the same folder as one of the imported files. Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.
 RUN button: After the user sets the parameters, he presses the RUN button and the mixing of the   documents starts.

     Hardware Interfaces
N/A
   Software Interfaces
PDFsam is compatible with every system supports a JRE and pdf files. That means that is independent from the operating system of the computer system on which it runs.
PDFsam runs on every platform where a Java Virtual Machine is available (requires a JVM version  or higher). It has been tested on various versions of Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux distributions and Mac OS X.
   Communications Interfaces
PDFsam is not a web application, so the network communication is only necessary to check for software updates.
The Check for updates option in the Settings panel
 
Software Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge   
  Other Nonfunctional Requirements    Performance Requirements
Furthermore, the system can check for updates whenever is requested by the user, or automatically when opening the application. In this way PDFsam will be always up-to-date with all new supported features and bug fixes.
   Safety Requirements
The application must ensure that it leaves untouched the input pdf files. No modification is allowed to these files.
Moreover, the application should function even in cases of wrong data insertion or wrong settings. In case of error it should provide users with appropriate help messages.
   Security Requirements
PDFsam does not introduce any security level, since the data it manages is not critical. The users in the application are all equal so there is not the need of any identity management level.
   Software Quality Attributes
This application provides a pleasant and user friendly graphical interface with relatively simple functions. Any user should be able to use PDFsam without any specific knowledge or experience by reading the user manuals (or the help messages that are embedded in the application). Users only need to provide some pdf documents and with just a few clicks they can perform any action.

1	Introduction


1.1	Purpose
[I] Throughout this PWS, each paragraph is marked with an [O], an [M] or an [I]. The [O] paragraphs are mandatory outcomes that specify the end result to be achieved by the Contractor. The [M] paragraphs are mandatory requirements that are required to be delivered by the Contractor. The fulfillment of the mandatory requirements supports achievement of the mandatory outcomes. The [I] paragraphs are intended to provide contextual information to the Contractor.
[I] The purpose of this PWS is to specify the In-Service Support (ISS) work to be provided by the Contractor for the Halifax-class Combat Systems (HCCS) Equipment Group (EG). The PWS also specifies the performance incentives which are linked to measureable outcomes.
[I] The HCCS In-Service Support Contract (ISSC) will be long-term, flexible, and performance based and will evolve over the life cycle of the Halifax-class. Through a relational framework, Canada and the Contactor will form a strategic partnership to achieve mutually successful outcomes through an alignment of contract parties’ interests and processes.
[I] The work to be carried out by the Contractor is tied to a series of performance measures selected to promote the ISS outcomes required by Canada.
[I] It is intended that the ISS Contract will follow a Phased implementation. The Start-Up Phase followed by the Steady-State and Close-Out Phases are described in more detail in Chapter 2.
[I] Interim support for the HCCS EG is currently provided through separate contracts with the OEMs. Canada intends to transition this work to the Contractor during the Start-Up Phase.
[I] This contract will be for an initial period of six (6) years, followed by a series of potential contract extensions for additional periods of one (1) year, in a ‘rolling wave’ format illustrated below, which will continue until the end of life of the Halifax-class. Performance will be one of the criteria assessed for the award of contract extensions.

1.3	Background

1.3.1	General
[I] Six systems, now referred to as the Halifax-class Combat Systems (HCCS) Equipment Group (EG), were retrofitted through the Halifax-class Modernization/Frigate Life Extension (HCM/FELEX) Combat System Integration (CSI) Design-and-Build (DAB) contract. Installation commenced in 2010 and is forecasted to be completed by 2018. Additional systems and simulators were also acquired for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) Fleet Schools, Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Scott (FMFCS), Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Breton (FMFCB), and the Naval Electronic Systems Test Range Atlantic (NESTRA) and Naval Electronic Systems Test Range Pacific (NESTRP).
[I]	The HCCS EG comprises the following:
a.	3D Radar System SMART-S (OEM: Thales, Netherlands);
b.	2D Radar System SG-180 (OEM: Saab Microwave, Sweden);
c.	Navigation Radar NSC-26 (OEM: Raytheon Anschuetz, Germany);
d.	Fire Control System CEROS200 (OEM: Saab Systems, Sweden);
e.	IFF System MK XIIA (OEM: Telephonics, USA);
f.	NS9003A-V2HC Electronic Support Measures (OEM Elisra, Israel; licenced Canadian Repair Facility is Lockheed Martin Canada); and
g.	Associated Test Equipment and Training Aids.
[I] In-Service Support (ISS) is currently provided through separate contracts with each Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).
[I] The HCCS ISSC will be a single contract in which the Contractor will work with the OEMs or authorized representatives of the OEMs for each of the HCCS EG systems to provide long term ISS.
 
1.3.2	Concept of Operations and ISS
[I] The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) currently operates twelve (12) Halifax-class frigates and intends to operate them until their end of life, which is currently estimated to be 2036. The HCCS EG is an integral component of the Halifax-class ships and will require ISS support until end of life for the Halifax-class.
[I] Of the twelve (12) Halifax-class frigates, seven (7) ships are assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic, located at Canadian Forces Base Halifax, Nova Scotia and five (5) ships are assigned to Maritime Forces Pacific, located at Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt, British Columbia.
[I] The Halifax-class frigates support the DND requirement to defend Canada and Canadian interests and contribute to international peace and security. The ships will be self-sufficient and able to participate and integrate into joint missions with the United States or multi-national forces anywhere in the world. The ships will be assigned tasks/missions to fulfill this requirement. The HCCS EG will support the ships in its conduct of these assigned tasks/missions. Ships are deployable, self-contained and capable of remaining on station for a prolonged period and will be capable of integrating into the larger Command and Control, Communication and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance capabilities provided at the joint or national levels. In support of the missions, the HCCS EG will provide a situational awareness capability to provide for the co-ordination of activities and assets for open ocean and littoral operations.
[I] In accordance with the Naval Materiel Management System Manual (NaMMS), the
Halifax-class makes use of Programmed Work Periods (PWPs).
[I] Programmed Work Periods require repair facility support and are comprised of Short Work Periods (SWPs), Assisted Maintenance Periods (AMPs), Docking Work Periods / Interim Docking (DWPs) and Refit/Extended Docking Work Periods (EDWPs).
[I] The Contractor will be required to provide In-Service Support on the HCCS Equipment Group installed in all twelve (12) Halifax-class ships, RCN Fleet Schools, Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Scott (FMFCS), Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Breton (FMFCB), and the Naval Electronic Systems Test Range Atlantic and Pacific (NESTRA, NESTRP). Special Tools and Test Equipment (STTE) located at some of these sites will also require In- Service Support.
[I] HCCS EG first and second level maintenance will be the responsibility of DND, and third level maintenance will be provided by the Contractor. However, the Contractor will have the capacity and capability to augment DND level one and two maintenance when requested, and conversely, DND may assist the Contractor to conduct level three maintenance.
[I] The Halifax-class ships are also supported by: a Halifax-class Design Agent and Support Services Contract, a Halifax-class Work Period Contract East (WPC-E), a Halifax- class Work Period Contract West (WPC-W), and the Combat Systems Integration (CSI) Contract.

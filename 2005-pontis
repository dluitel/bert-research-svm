 1.0 Introduction
This report documents the functional requirements specification (FRS) for the next generation of the Pontis Bridge Management System (BMS), referred to as   throughout. These include the functional requirements, which describe the operations that users must perform using  , the non- functional requirements, which describe the manner in which the software will be designed, developed, and deployed, and the plan for implementation of  .
Throughout this document, the terms “shall” and “will” are used to identify specific functions and capabilities that   must provide (e.g., Pontis inspection interface shall provide the ability to perform data validation on National Bridge Inventory items). The terms “may” and “might” are used to indicate functions and capabilities that may or may not be included in the final product (e.g., Pontis may provide a direct link to GIS software for map-based querying). The status of these items will be resolved through future detailed software design activity or through progress by other vendors in the development and deployment of Pontis add-in applications.
Note that this document is not intended to describe the architecture or data model of  , nor is it intended to describe the specific design or implementation plan for any functional requirement. This information will appear in later   system design documents. Preliminary work has been performed to outline the technical architecture for  , and a Technical Architecture Description (TAD) was developed in 2003.1 The TAD presents a future vision for the project, emphasizing a web application, an advanced database architecture, maximum reuse of user reports and forms, and a flexible, extensible user interface.
This document, once approved in final form, indicates agreement between the AASHTO Pontis Task Force, on behalf of the Pontis licensing agencies, and Cambridge Systematics, on the specific functions and capabilities that   must provide, providing a clear and specific scope of services for the software design and development effort. Any subsequent changes to the functional requirements must be carefully reviewed and considered, because they may impact the project schedule and/or or expand the scope of work beyond that which is covered by the design and development contract between AASHTO and the software developer.

 This document follows the structure and outline of the Volere Requirements Specification Template.2 This approach was identified in previous discussions and documents.3 Some sections of this template do not apply to  , and have therefore been marked as such in the text of this report, or omitted in their entirety.
The TAD provides a general architecture for the future version of Pontis. It does not elaborate requirements for the new system in detail, although it does identify key stakeholders and stakeholder concerns to be considered in the future Pontis version. A specific requirements gathering effort is necessary before the design and implementation of   may commence.
To that end, the BRIDGEWare Task Force has designated the contractor, Cambridge Systematics, to undertake a requirements gathering process with guidance and substantive input from a set of bridge management and information systems experts who will serve as a Technical Advisory Group (TAG). Cambridge Systematics and the TAG work within the framework of the Volere Requirements Process Model as the formal requirements development methodology .
In the Volere methodology, there are several main phases:
 Project Blastoff - Define the project scope, context, and participants, and initiate the requirements process
 Trawling For Knowledge - Collect information needed to write the requirements document
 Reporting - Compile the requirements and write the requirements document
 Quality Gateway – (continuously) Review the requirements as they are
drafted for completeness, relevance, and viability
 Prototyping and Scenario Modeling – (eventually) Develop low-fidelity and/or high-fidelity (HiFi) prototypes to better develop the requirements
 Perform Requirements Gathering Effort Post-mortem (Retrospective Review) - review outcome of the requirements process following completion of the requirements document
 Take Stock Of The Requirements – Determine if the requirements are complete and internally consistent
These phases culminate in this requirements specification which can move forward to the formal software design phase.

 2.0 Project Drivers
2.1 PURPOSE OF THE PRODUCT
  will provide licensing agencies with an up-to-date tool for bridge management, including data management, condition assessment, model development, needs analysis, reporting, and interaction with other agency systems.   will be the next generation of the Pontis product, currently deployed in more than 45 agencies in the U.S. and abroad. This product is intended to replace the existing Pontis 4.x product line with a next-generation software application, utilizing state-of-the-art software development technology.   will build on and preserve licensee investments of time and money in Pontis 4.x implementation.
The next generation of Pontis eventually will offer the full functionality of the currently deployed Pontis 4.4. The baseline capabilities will be extended to provide licensees the ability to access selected modules from a web browser as well as a dedicated client application, depending on the particular BMS activity. A web version of Pontis will offer easier application setup, administration, and implementation, and will provide a straightforward migration path for existing Pontis 4.x users.
  will support a range of new functionality, including: import and export of data in eXstensible Markup Language (XML) based on the TransXML schema being developed through National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 20-64, XML Schemas for Exchange of Transportation Data (TransXML); improved approaches to modeling bridge needs through incorporation of research results from NCHRP 12-67, Multiple-Objective Optimization for Bridge Management Systems; improved user interfaces for bridge-level analysis and project planning; and support for multiple asset types. Further,   will provide seamless support to its licensees for potential changes in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) coding standards.
The development of   is driven in part by new functional requirements as well as by dramatic technology changes in the software development arena that have overtaken the existing client/server application, particularly in the web application development domain.
Specific Goals for  
The goals for   are to provide the AASHTO member agencies and licensees with:
 A readily-accessible, robust repository for bridge information, including data inventory, condition, needs, project plans, and accomplishments;
     2-1

  
  Technically correct capabilities to perform bridge management tasks of all types;
 A technologically up-to-date development foundation;
 Streamlined, simpler application and deployment mechanisms;
 A flexible, customizable application which users can extend to solve agency- specific bridge management tasks; and
 Preservation of significant agency investments in BMS generally and Pontis specifically, including expenditures of time, money, training and other agency resources.
The Technical Architecture Description (TAD) identifies additional goals and concerns of a number of Pontis stakeholders, which are reflected in these summary goals.4
In this context, the bold-faced terms appearing above are defined as follows:
Readily accessible means that information stored in   should be available to most users via Microsoft Internet Explorer from any computer via a network or Internet connection; and the software enables users to access the majority of data and capabilities without specialized technical skills or training.
Robust means that: a) the repository is built on a commercial, high-quality relational database management system (RDBMS); b) the information contained in the system is secure, with access limited to appropriate staff and agency- designated parties; c) information contained in the system can be backed up in a secure location on a regular schedule; and d) the system is reliable and in operation at an acceptable levels of availability and performance. Pontis 4.4 and 5.0 address item (a) and (d) but assign primary responsibility for (b) and (c) to licensing agencies.
Technically correct capabilities means that the various analysis and calculation in   operate consistently and comparably with existing versions, and where there may be opportunities for improvements or innovation in technical capabilities these are well-understood, well-defined, and verifiable in the deployed application. As an example, continued proper calculation of NBI Translator results will be part of achieving this goal.
Technologically up-to-date mandates the design and development of the next generation Pontis application using next generation tools, such as .NET, web services, SOAP, XML, Model-View-Controller architecture, and others.
Streamlined, simpler administration means that agencies will find it easier and faster to install, deploy, and upgrade the application, and manage its operation.

      must address this objective explicitly and must be significantly improved over current version(s).
Flexible, customizable means that the application provides innate mechanisms for extending and adapting the database schema, foundation capabilities, and user presentation elements such as forms and reports. This has been a key benefit of the existing product. The future   product should be capable of adapting to changes in data requirements, reporting, standards, and other influencing factors.
Preservation of agency investments means that the significant body of effort to develop staff expertise, data, reports, data forms, procedures, manuals, training courses, and the multitude of other BMS-related agency products must be explicitly acknowledged and preserved in   to the greatest extent possible. This goal also means providing a straightforward migration path for Pontis and integrated BRIDGEWare databases when moving to  .
We explicitly recognize that these priorities and needs may change over time, and that the functional requirements and technical design may necessarily adapt to accommodate these changes in priorities and needs.
2.2 STAKEHOLDERS
The TAD identifies Pontis stakeholders in some detail, and these continue to be applicable. The TAD outlines issues of concern to each stakeholder class which form a basis for identifying constraints on the   functional requirements. The stakeholders defined in the TAD include:
 End users, grouped into:
– power users, who typically would manage an agency’s Pontis database
and/or make heavy use of its analytic/modeling capabilities;
– routine users, such as bridge inspectors or staff data analysts, responsible for primary data collection, quality reviews, and normal data reporting. These are the predominant set of Pontis users; and
– casual users, such as planning or programming staff using Pontis inventory data and analytical results.
 Agencies: the governmental or other entities responsible for procuring and operating Pontis;
 AASHTO: the software product’s owner;
 Developers: those responsible for building and maintaining BRIDGEWare
components, including third party developers;
 Integrators: those who integrate Pontis services or data with other tools and systems; and
  2-3

  
  Deployers: those responsible for installing, configuring and customizing Pontis for use.
All the stakeholders are still important, but for the requirements development phase, we are highlighting the most important stakeholders concerned with reviewing and approving requirements in this FRS. The table below identifies the key front-line Pontis stakeholders and outlines their role with respect to the product.

   2.3
USERS OF THE PRODUCT
Pontis users are classified as described in the following paragraphs for the purposes of this requirements document.
 Inspectors: inspectors may be agency staff inspecting bridges full or part- time/seasonally, or consultants. Briefly, their responsibilities entail original bridge data collection, review, and database quantification. Their activities may also include developing field work recommendations and accomplishment verification. These users may or may not be licensed engineers;
 Bridge project planners: staff responsible for development, review, approval, and tracking of bridge work of all types, whether maintenance, improvements, rehabilitation or replacement;
 Bridge management engineers: staff responsible for multiple aspects of bridge management, concerned with inspection program accomplishment,
 2-4
 
    program development and implementation, bridge policies, and other overarching concerns such as truck routing and permit review;
 Bridge design/rating engineers: staff responsible for bridge design and rating, who may need information from Pontis when making engineering decisions, and who may contribute structure design and capacity information to Pontis;
 Highway information analysts: staff responsible for collection and maintenance of various data of concern to bridge management such as roadway service levels, traffic, routing restrictions, etc;
 Highway program planners: staff concerned with integration of project plans within highway corridors, and in particular, to acknowledge, review, and incorporate bridge project recommendations originating from bridge management or other sources, and to provide feedback to bridge management on project accomplishments; and
 Other Pontis users: staff with interest in bridge information such as executives, public relations officers, engineering firms (primarily serving as inspection contractors), and other casual users of the system. These users may or may not have an engineering background and are primarily concerned with data review, performance measures identification and tracking, and summary inventory/condition reports.
Clearly some of these users fall into secondary and tertiary categories. Where there is a conflict, the requirements of the key internal users must take priority over those of secondary users. The tertiary category of users may make use of Pontis, but have no vested interest in the product. The requirements of these users are of lowest priority.
2.4 PROJECT CONSTRAINTS
This section describes constraints on the requirements and the eventual design of the product. These constraints reflect a number of stakeholder concerns identified in the TAD.
Development Technology Constraints
  will be developed using Microsoft technologies, as follows:
   will be a Microsoft .NET application consisting of a combination of stand-alone, thin client, and back-end server applications. There may be duplicative capabilities between the thin-client and the stand-alone implementations. Providing a stand-alone field inspection application for disconnected users as well as a web inspection interface is an example.
 The thin client will be designed and tested for the latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer, version to be determined during design.
  2-5

  
  The stand-alone application will require workstations with the .NET Runtime Framework installed and the Windows XP operating system. The specific version will be determined during design. While the .NET Framework is distributed as part of the Windows operating system and with .NET applications for end users, .NET server licenses likely will be needed as well, which may mean an expense for licensing agencies.
 The server application will expect and rely on the .NET Framework and the common language runtime (CLR).
 Microsoft Visual Studio .NET will be used as the primary development tool for  . The development languages will be heterogeneous and determined appropriately for the application context and therefore may include Visual Basic .NET, C#, ASP.NET scripting, or others as appropriate.
   will maximize the use of third-party code libraries, whether fee- licensed or open-source, to minimize original development costs to the greatest extent possible.
General Solution Constraints
 The   thin-client will be designed so it can be made available to users via agency internal network and over the Internet, as appropriate for different application contexts, with final deployment arrangement determined by each licensee.
   will take full advantage of web display capabilities including, in particular, screen real estate management to minimize scrolling, paging and tabbing.
 The BRIDGEWare database design for   will be consistent with the database design for Pontis 4.4. Changes are very likely to be necessary but proposed database changes will need to be reviewed and approved by the BRIDGEWare Database Technical Advisory Group (TAG) as part of the   design approval process following the agreed database change protocol.5
 Pontis will support its existing relational databases (RDBMS) of Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server as the database for its information repository. The versions of each vendor’s RDBMS will be determined as part of the software design and
5 The BRIDGEWare Task Forces have established a specific protocol for requesting, reviewing, and approving any database changes. Each proposed change is described, prioritized, and assigned to an impact/threat category. Substantive justification must be provided for every change, and no changes are permitted to the BRIDGEWare database design without the consensus of the database Technical Advisory Group (TAG).
   2-6
 
    implementation plan. No additional database support is anticipated as of this writing, but the design will adhere strictly to ANSI-SQL and ODBC/JDBC/.NET standards in order to maximize the potential to support additional databases in the future.
 Pontis bridge information will integrate with a more general asset management database structure which may incorporate other types of assets such as sign structures, high-mast towers, walls, pavements, or buildings.
   will be a GIS-aware application that must operate properly within an agency’s GIS technology whether ESRI, Intergraph, Open GIS, or others. Pontis must observe industry standard protocols in this regard and avoid vendor specific implementation approaches.
Anticipated Application Workplace Environments
  will be used both in field contexts, such as an open-air bridge inspection, where environmental factors (weather, sunlight) may influence program operation and no network connectivity may be assumed, as well as in a typical agency office environment, which will impose no special restrictions or requirements on the design or operation of the system.6
2.5 NAMING CONVENTIONS AND DEFINITIONS
This document relies on transportation and information technology terms that are in common use and do not require detailed definitions. Where a conflict arises, the current Pontis 4.x terminology will apply.7
The development of   will adhere to a separate software development standards document which will itself incorporate naming conventions.
2.6 RELEVANT FACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
This section describes assumptions made by the project team as well as any known external factors that affect and/or constrain the   system. A brief discussion is presented here. Where appropriate, the external factors may be elaborated further in separate memoranda or the detailed design.
   must not assume a uniform operating environment and must accommodate both disconnected and connected users.
6 No special support for tablet or handheld computers is anticipated at present but supporting this type of technology may well become a design constraint at some point.
7 The reader is invited to review the Pontis 4.x User and Technical Manuals, and in particular, the Glossary of Terms, as well as the Federal NBI coding guide for bridge inspection terminology.
   2-7

  
    must maintain consistency with the existing deployed 4.x application, which in effect serves to a great extent as a hi-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype for  .
 The   design must incorporate any Federal NBI changes that may arise during the design and development period.
   must use technology that the member agencies of AASHTO can deploy and support, hence, the general constraint identified earlier – that   will be a Microsoft .NET application, utilizing industry standard RDBMS technologies.
 The actual development strategy will minimize original coding in favor of utilizing third-part libraries, even at the expense of possibly foregoing some functionality that custom coding could provide. It should be understood clearly by reviewers that this sort of tradeoff of cost and functionality may well retroactively influence the final   requirements8. This further implies that some current Pontis 4.4 capabilities may be implemented very differently in a future version in order to take advantage of available commercial and open-source code.
   will be designed as a deployed/installed application in agencies, and not designed as a hosted application, although it may well operate perfectly acceptably in a hosted configuration, such as a Citrix environment.
   American Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance9 constraints on the functional requirements will be determined by AASHTO in consultation with its member agencies. The level and approach for achieving compliance remains an open issue to be resolved10.
   will be a licensed product, which AASHTO will maintain ownership over, and which will be deployed with license protection to certain licensees such as consultants, international agencies, and academic institutions11.
   must interact effectively and properly with the other BRIDGEWare products.
8 As of this version, no particular third-party software has been selected for use in  .
9 Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act: Accessibility in the Information Age can be found at http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/report2/web.htm
10 No particular accommodation for ADA compliance is currently incorporated in the requirements as of this revision.
11 Copy protection is not enforced in Pontis 4.x for U.S. licensing agencies and it is assumed that policy will prevail for  . The arrangement for licensing web application users is to be determined at a later stage.
   2-8
 
       must provide two-way XML data exchange with TransXML schema once it is established.
 The design of   will be informed by review of the results of NCHRP Project 12-67, Multiple-Objective Optimization for Bridge Management Systems. Additional funding may be required to modify the Pontis modeling approach to incorporate new approaches developed as part of this project. The estimates in this document to not attempt to quantify such additional funding requirements.
   must provide well-defined and documented access to selected product functionality and data for third-party developers.
 The   business rules will be similar to those of Pontis 4.x.
 Where a conflict arises between 5.0 requirements and 4.x behavior, or when a 4.x feature is being abandoned or significantly reworked, this design decision will be explicitly documented and justified. For example, the Pontis formula language and support for Pontis 2.0 file exchange formats are very likely to be discarded in  . A conflict or concern may arise where there is an explicitly identified improvement to the 4.x functional design, such as the organization and operation of the Select tool for selecting bridges on the Pontis desktop in a Web deployed environment. An agreed procedure and protocol will be needed to facilitate making a collective decision on these sorts of highly visible functional changes.
 The Project Planning module will be redesigned and replaced.

    4.0 Functional Requirements
This section of the report outlines the functional requirements for   – the specific tasks and activities that the software enables, other functions needed to support the software, and the data that are required to support these requirements. The requirements are organized loosely around a set of   use cases. Each requirement is numbered for convenience. Please note that the “may” requirements in version 0.2 of the FRS have been moved to Section 7.4 - Waiting Room - for future review and discussion.
A separate database of requirements presents each of these narrative requirements generally following the Volere Requirements template specification and may be reviewed in conjunction with this document. In the   requirements database, requirements that apply only to the thin-client or thick- client implementations are tagged for clarity. Where appropriate, requirements that involve configurable control of program behavior are noted. For example, it may be that a user is not allowed multiple sessions of the application by agency policy, hence the requirement has a configuration implication.
The numbering convention below is to first identify the use case e.g., UC-1 View Bridge Data, then to document individual requirements within the use case e.g., ...
1.3 The user shall be able to select structures by structure ID, district, county, administrative area (geographic group), ownership, custodianship, functional class, NHS status, on/off system, inspector, bridge group, inspection due dates, and all or some environment and elements. The query shall be restricted depending on the user privilege.
...
Requirements surrounded by boxes are new or significantly updated requirements for  .
4.1 BROWSE DATA
UC-1 View Bridge Data
1.1 The user shall be able to view the data stored in the Physical Inventory tables through the Pontis graphical user interface (GUI).
1.2 The user shall be able to switch between predefined structure lists.
1.3 The user shall be able to select structures by structure ID, district, county, administrative area (geographic group), ownership, custodianship, functional class, NHS status, on/off system, inspector, bridge group, inspection due dates, and all or some environment and elements. The query shall be restricted depending on the user privilege.
  4-1

  
The user shall be able to find structures based on the structure ID, structure name, feature intersected, facility carried, route number, LRS Inventory Route, KM/mile posts, structure types, design types and materials, and by searching the notes fields. The query shall be restricted depending on the user privilege.
The user shall be able to enter a WHERE clause of the SQL query in the Find and the Filter window and run a query against the bridges in the database. The query will be verified by the application and SQL errors will be reported to the user for correction. This capability shall be an application privilege. Bridge-level security of the user shall be applied automatically.
The user shall be able to select a structure by directly typing in the structure ID in GUI, with the display scrolling to that structure. Bridge-level security of the user shall be applied automatically.
The system shall display the data in the appropriate unit of measurement as configured for the application. This will be a permanent modal setting for the application. This setting shall be configurable (as stipulated in Requirement 22.1).
The user shall be able to select bridges on a supported map display and generate a bridge list for use within Pontis, for example, to perform a simulation analysis or to generate an inspection roster.
View Project Data
The user shall be able to view the data stored in the Project Planning tables through the GUI.
The user shall be able to switch between predefined project lists.

The system shall provide a fixed set of predefined, secured, administration reports to document users, user roles, application privileges, user login sessions, checked-out bridges, and other key information necessary to manage application operation.

DATA REQUIREMENTS
A full, detailed data model for Pontis 5.0 will become part of the Pontis 5.0 System Design and is beyond the scope of this document. The Pontis 4.x/BRIDGEWare database design is assumed as the basis for these requirements except as indicated. The following is a list of basic table groupings as defined in the Pontis Technical Manual.
 Physical Inventory: This set of tables contains data related to an agency’s physical bridge inventory. These include general inventory data, work candidates recommendations, structures exchanged during the check- in/check-out process, multimedia document links, and optional agency- specific inventory data.
 Program Simulation: These tables store data related to the program simulation process. They contain elicitation data, deterioration model updating data, preservation policy, flexible action definitions, program simulation inputs, and simulation results.
 Project Planning: These tables contain information about programs and funding sources, projects and their work items, agency-defined project data, and temporarily stored work items used to support the bridge analysis functionality .
 Definition: Pontis system definitions are stored in these tables.
 Application System: Application system tables store configuration data required for running Pontis. The tables contain system data including the data dictionary, parameter, configurable options, data on users and their roles, formulas, and other system data. It is likely that extensive changes will be made in these tables for  , particularly to support auditing, logging, versioning, user authentication and session management, and other new capabilities.


    5.0 Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 LOOK AND FEEL REQUIREMENTS
The EIM&DSS design will be informed by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) design guidelines26 and conform to common industry practices for user interaction behavior and user interface design. For the thin-client portion of Pontis, the AASHTO standards for thin-client web-based applications software will be followed.
The software, through its user interface, will clearly identify the product name ( .x), the licensee, the connected user, and the organization that developed the system (AASHTO). Additional session identification information will be available on demand.27 The overall look and feel of the product will be that of a professional and conservative application.
  will, at AASHTO’s direction, adopt any elements of the look and feel of other existing AASHTOWare/BRIDGEWare applications where appropriate. In particular, UI conventions from Virtis/Opis will be reviewed to ensure that the   does not differ markedly in appearance. AASHTO may designate such model applications and must provide the development team with access to fully-documented style sheets/UI layouts or demonstration software to support this requirement.
There will be no support for individual personalization of the user interface (skins) other than the availability of certain features that are tied to a user role (e.g. not all users will have the ability to edit bridge data and thus will not see an “Edit On” button on the corresponding screen).
5.2 USABILITY REQUIREMENTS
  will be designed to be as straightforward and intuitive as possible, and familiar to existing users. The user interface will provide effective navigation, visual referencing, and task sequencing. Users will have access to on-line help throughout the UI.
The application should look and feel consistent in the web and standalone operating environments, therefore it will conform to standard .NET standalone
 Word Wide Web Consortium, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, November 2004 (http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)..
 Pontis 4.x Help About and SysInfo windows provide examples.

  
 5.3
and web application conventions with necessary accommodations for the deployment environment only where these prove necessary and appropriate.
As a general goal, Pontis users should be comfortable operating and using the software after two full days of training. Users who only wish to access and display bridge information should be comfortable operating and using the software after two hours of training. System administrators should be comfortable operating and maintaining the software after user training and one full day of system administration training.
The system developer shall consider supporting existing custom forms and reports developed in PowerBuilder 9. It shall decide on a development tool for users so that they can continue to customize Pontis and extend its capability. For example, custom forms and reports created with PowerBuilder 9 may be migrated to a .NET application by using the Sybase DataWindow .NET technology which is available in PowerBuilder 10.
Integrating DataWindow .NET is likely a short-term strategy to ease migration of user forms and reports to  . A stated objective for   is eliminating dependency on PowerBuilder. Ideally, the application should not require any particular vendor technology for report or form generation, such as InfoMaker/PowerBuilder, so a sunset plan must be developed to outline a strategy to meet this objective. However, the application shall continue to provide a plug-in capability to integrate third-party .NET data displays and reports in the user workspace.28
PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

This section describes general performance requirements for  , including its capacity (the volume of all types of data that can be stored in the repository) and its speed (the time it takes to execute certain types of operations).
Some factors that determine the ultimate performance of Pontis are outside the control of this project, and rely instead on decisions and actions of each agency that implements Pontis:
 The capacity and speed of the commercial RDBMS product used for the data repository;
 The speed of the servers on which Pontis, the RDBMS, the analytical and other processing engines, and other information resources are installed;
    Plug-in reports and forms may continue to be based on PowerBuilder at the user’s discretion. The plug-in must be capable of handling this technology for the foreseeable future, but not solely dependent on it.
 
     The effective speed and congestion levels on the network that connects the servers and client machines running the application; and
 A standalone database engine will continue to be necessary. Performance objectives for the standalone database should be comparable.
Some of these factors may make it impossible to achieve the performance requirements for   outlined in this section. However, based on our assessment of the existing condition of most agency systems and infrastructure, we think this outcome is unlikely.
There are selected licensees, typically smaller agencies, who may have much lower powered computer resources, and their performance must be acceptable as well, although not necessarily comparable to larger installations.
Capacity
The   repository must be able to store the following quantities of bridges, work recommendations, scenarios, projects, and users at a minimum:

Comments
This number is approached by some licensees already.
Most bridges will have no recommendations at all, or a small number of them( 20 or fewer).
The number of scenarios that can be stored and displayed in Pontis concurrently.
The number of projects that can be stored and displayed in Pontis concurrently.
A concomitant number of work items for each project ay be expected, perhaps 15 per project
The number of users accessing key functions – running simulations, updating models, etc. – is expected to be fewer than 5 on a routine basis.
These are transactional read-write users. The purpose of this number is to provide a design guideline for hardware specifications to be developed later on in this project. Pontis will not impose any particular limitation on the number of simultaneous users. Agency web servers may restrict the number of simultaneous web sessions.
Report and data browsing users, for all deployment environments
Users that will create the reports at off peak hours and post the results to the website. This could be higher if there is a time issues with the number of long running reports being generated.

  This section presents speed targets for specific system functions. The apparent speed of many operations will be affected by network latency (delays due to transmission of text and images from the Pontis application server to the client desktop machine and web browser, or for standalone operations). The times indicated in the table represent user-experienced response times.
The target times indicated in the table represent 90% thresholds – that is, the performance requirement specified here means that the indicated functions will take less than the indicated length of time an average of 9 out of 10 times.
 Operation Target Time
(seconds)
Login/Logout 2
Redisplay typical desktop 5-10 (on startup, zoom, reselect,
or other change), assume
250 bridges
Create a new bridge 3 record
Comments
Depends primarily on database and network performance
This value applies for displaying the Pontis desktop selection (assuming presentation similar to Pontis 4.x)29
For example, creating a new inspection or a new structure.
    Localization has had a demonstrable impact on GUI performance.   may rework this to improve screen display speed and will address localization properly as an architectural issue/constraint.
 
 
  Export 50 bridges Import 50 bridges
Retrieve and display single bridge (inspection) detail
Retrieve and display single project detail

About 2 bridges per second, varies with type of export file and scope of exported information.
About 2 bridges per second, likely slower than export, varies with type of import file and scope of imported information.
Will take longer if digital photographs, plan data, or other no-native content are being accessed.
Better than 3 bridges per second. 
Will vary substantially by report type.
Will vary by report type and data volume
Will vary by simulation time frame
Will vary by number of bridges and whether history is used.
 
 Reliability and Availability
  Pontis 5.0 is not strictly a transactional application or mission-critical for most capabilities. In light of this, the application shall be available for use 18 hours per day, 353 days per year, reserving 6 hours per day and one day per month for routine agency network and infrastructure maintenance. During normal times of operation, Pontis shall achieve 98 percent up time.
Because   is not a mission-critical application, there will be no attempt to design or construct the system for uninterrupted operation. Agencies may choose to implement database transaction logging, mirroring, or switchover to backup servers in the event of a hardware or network failure, but support for these decisions or implementation are beyond the scope of   effort. Procedures and equipment for backups (database and software) and disaster recovery are also outside the scope of this effort.

  
 5.4 OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
This section outlines the minimal requirements for effectively operating  . The requirements for both thin-client and thick-client applications are discussed. Specific items are to be determined.
The Pontis application server (ASP.NET) software will run on a server located within a (presumably) secure facility at each agency. Because it is an ASP.NET application, the end users can vary in location depending on the network accessibility of the server. The Pontis database, and any other databases to be accessed from Pontis may be co-located on the same server machine, but at a minimum must be accessible from the Pontis application server via standard database communication and connection protocols.
The server machine will run Windows Server 2003 or, given technology evolution, a descendant target server environment identified in the implementation plan. The server machine must have all necessary software to run an ASP.NET application. This specifically includes, but may not be limited to, IIS30, the .NET Framework and ASP.NET. Other web servers, appliances, and add-in technologies may also be necessary depending on the final application design.
Back-end server stored procedures and server-side functions will be supported and may be assumed to be usable in the technical design of  . This will require implementation of the triggers in native DBMS procedural code. This implies that it is very likely that the server-side code will vary for each target DBMS, even if the interfaces remain identical, increasing the development and testing effort with the significant benefit of assigning processing to the appropriate application tier(s).
  will be designed to be used with Internet Explorer; it may work correctly with other browsers but this cannot be guaranteed. Given the predominance of IE in the browser market, it does not appear to be necessary to consider support for other browsers, although this may need to be reconsidered if external customers are running the application(s) and need to employ different browser technology such as Netscape or Mozilla FireFox.
Standalone capabilities will require a workstation running the latest .NET Framework, presumably Windows XP Professional (SP2) or its successor. Some capabilities may require a network connection. The workstation’s hardware requirements will be similar to those of the existing Pontis 4.4 application. There will continue to be a standalone/runtime database engine provided with the application for offline work. The offline database is assumed to be Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere release 9 or above.]
 The TAG should strongly consider the need to support HTTP/www servers other than IIS. Apache and its variants are the most widely-used web servers on the net and a rich platform to exploit open source capabilities. However, many agencies rely on IIS, so this technology consideration must be resolved as part of the design. Other AASHTOWare products (Trans*port) already vary from the IIS standard.  

5.5 INSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT
For a thick-client portion of Pontis, an installer program will be provided to install Pontis on the user’s computer. The user shall be able to remove Pontis by using the Windows Add/Remove Programs capability. When necessary, the SQL scripts will be provided to upgrade a previous version of Pontis database to a new version and apply any patches. The system may be capable of supporting automatic upgrades and maintenance fixes using the push technology.
  shall be able to coexist with earlier versions of Pontis on the same computer.
5.6 MAINTAINABILITY AND PORTABILITY REQUIREMENTS
  shall comply with AASHTO application development standards based on the published recommendations of the AASHTO Technical Applications and Architecture (TA&A) subcommittee.
The latest released versions of Microsoft tools including Visual Studio .NET, ASP.NET, .NET Framework, and databases such as Microsoft SQL Server will be used. The actual versions, the database release version in particular, will be determined as part of the implementation plan and put under configuration management.
All source code written by the contractor will be provided to AASHTO, and reasonable effort will be made to develop clearly documented source code which can be maintained after contract by other than the original developers.
All modules developed in   will support automatic testing except as explicitly distinguished in the technical design. Every module will be delivered with a testing driver module.
No commitment regarding the portability of the code is made other than that implied by the use of standard Microsoft .NET tools and well-documented third- party application libraries or frameworks.
  in production is intended to be supported through complete and sufficient on-line help and documentation and equivalent printed documentation, with occasional additional assistance provided through the Pontis Support Center.   will also continue to provide field-level help where applicable. As with the existing Pontis 4.x product, it is assumed that support will be provided by telephone, via e-mail, and through an on-line issues tracking system.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
  security is a mix of database security and application security. Overall security is provided by the database and the   user authentication mechanisms with more refined security over program capabilities - e.g. create a bridge - being addressed by the application.
It is assumed that authentication will utilize a single sign-on (SSO) approach and application security will be declaratively managed through database or directory entries, rather than hard-wired into the application. This mechanism may have implications for BRIDGEWare/AASHTOWare generally and will need to be coordinated with the other AASHTO products31.
Database security will need to be insured for the Pontis data stored in the RDBMS; most likely this will be done by using a specific username/password combination and running as particular database roles for each database connection. This security structure should be similar to the existing security approach in Pontis 4.x. For web clients, care will be taken to insure that connection information is not accessible from application pages (e.g., userid/password embedded in HTML form variables).
The application level security controls will be consistent with current Pontis 4.x procedures, except more comprehensive; no exceptional controls are required. A specific requirement addresses field-level data security.
For normal users, the configurability of the system via the interface will be limited to changing the parameters used to perform the various analyses and modeling functions. Access to all other configuration parameters, such as module access, will be restricted to Pontis super users or application administrators.
There are no specific privacy or immunity (antivirus) requirements for   identified at this time.
CULTURAL AND POLITICAL REQUIREMENTS
As there are no evident cultural or political application requirements for  , this section of the Functional Requirements document does not apply for the most part. However, the product likely will be designed for agency/international localization from the ground up with respect to user interface elements, reports, messages, and other application attributes where native language support is necessary. This capability will be usable by all licensing agencies as desired, on an optional basis, to customize the appearance of the product to suit their internal standards. This capability will be analogous to the localization capability of Pontis 4.4 but more comprehensive in scope.
 Single sign-on technology is an issue that SCOJD and TAA should address for all AASHTOWare products. It appears that Kerberos is the most common basis, and Microsoft uses Kerberos for its Active Directory Services. Kerberos is also well supported by database vendors.

LEGAL REQUIREMENTS
The system shall be capable of exporting the NBI data in the specified NBI format as outlined in the NBI guideline. The system shall be capable supporting the future NBI coding guide changes.

    6.0 Implementation Plan 6.1 OVERVIEW
In order to develop an approximation of the total effort involved and create the development plan necessary for project planning, three implementation alternatives have been identified for consideration by the BRIDGEWare Task Force. These alternatives are quite different from each other, particularly in terms of schedule and user impacts. The alternatives are specified in terms of effort, schedule, and deliverables.
Development effort is estimated as outlined in section 6.2. The estimating approach provides a standardized mechanism for estimating the complexity of the effort involved in providing a component of  , which can be transformed into development hours or cost. Based on the estimate of development effort, three alternative development approaches have been prepared. The schedules for   are intrinsically linked to the product’s revenue cycles which are directly related to subscribership. Hence, the schedules shown for the alternatives reflect available monies and assume no solicitation effort will be undertaken.
The three alternatives proposed for consideration are:
1. Dedicated Design and Release, where the entire   product is designed, developed, tested, and delivered as a single multi-year effort, with an explicit cutover to the new version at a future point in time. There are no interim releases or initial products in this alternative;
2. Phased Design and Release, where components of   are designed, developed, tested, and delivered on a flow basis as a multi-year effort, with initial efforts focused on delivering a web based inspection module; and
3. Dedicated Design and Phased Release, which varies from the second alternative by explicitly calling out a dedicated design task that will start and conclude before incremental phased development of   components commences.
Each of these alternatives is discussed below, with a summary, an outline of driving assumptions, an outline of major development tasks, resources, and schedule, and a revenue analysis.
Note that each alternative assumes that the Pontis and Virtis/Opis contractors will coordinate throughout the design of   and that the Virtis/Opis contractor will be funded outside of the Pontis effort to review Pontis design documents.

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS APPROACH
The functional size of   has been estimated using the Common Software Measurement International Consortium Full Function Points (COSMIC-FFP) method.32 The COSMIC-FFP size scale is based exclusively on Functional User Requirements, defined as “the user practices and procedures that the software must perform to fulfill the users’ needs.” Functional user requirements exclude quality requirements and any technical requirements. The COSMIC-FFP method is designed to work for “data-rich” and “real-time” software, and it provides the concepts of software layers and tiers to help differentiate functional user requirements allocated at different levels of functional abstraction. More information on this methodology can be found in Appendix A.
The COSMIC-FFP method results in an estimate of Cosmic function size units (CFSU). This estimate is multiplied by an adjustment factor reflecting application complexity to obtain “Adjusted CFSU,” and it may then be scaled as appropriate to yield an estimate in terms of hours or development cost. The cost estimate for Pontis is presented in Table 6.1. Costs were calibrated by comparing actual development costs to CFSU estimates for recent Pontis efforts. Note that the COSMIC-FFP method is not capable of providing an estimate of the cost of developing the basic application framework and C++ wrappers, so these items were estimated separately based on expert judgment.
Note that the estimates provided below are for the development costs only and do not include the cost of design or testing. Design costs are anticipated to be 25 percent of the development costs, with an additional $25,000 for each design document produced. Testing each release is expected to cost $55,000.

 A single large project with a complete deliverable package is more focused than a phased effort with numerous design, develop, and release cycles, allowing a dedicated, continuous development team effort;
 Changes in technology will be relatively stable (e.g. the development framework will not change radically over time, and importantly the work done early in the development effort will not need to be revisited later, and possibly overhauled or significantly reworked, in response to a technology change33);
 The entire design and development effort can be contracted out as a package with a fixed price;
 The effort can be broken down by contract period to accommodate revenue cycles, if necessary; and
 Pontis 4.x will continue to be maintained throughout the development period until all capabilities are delivered, and at least 2 interim releases may be needed to address interim functional needs in the user base.

Key Deliverables
The key deliverables for this approach are:
 Prototypes: Three software prototypes will be developed and demonstrated to the client as part of the software design.
 Design Document: The system requirements and software design decisions will be documented in a detailed design document.
   Alpha Release: This version of the software will incorporate all the functionality outlined in the design document, and will be used for internal testing by CS developers.
   Beta Release: This version of the software will be released to Pontis users for Beta testing.
   Final Release: The final version of the software will be released to Pontis users no later than December 2009.
Schedule
The tasks and schedule for this alternative are presented in Appendix B. The cost estimate is summarized in Section 6.6.
 This stable technology assumption was a key factor in the Virtis/Opis decision to focus on a COM-based approach, and it has been proven correct until very recently when .NET has emerged to replace COM.
  
 
    6.4 ALTERNATIVE 2 – PHASED DESIGN AND RELEASE APPROACH
Overview
The phased design and release approach delivers significant components of   serially over time with rolling cycles of design, development, testing, and deployment, highlighted by an initial focus on developing the web inspection component. This approach features multiple, less elaborate releases, with more user feedback contributing to the design of later components. It stresses initial development of a stable framework for the product which persists through the several development cycles. There is no “massive” release, but there may be significant impacts from multiple database upgrades, functionality releases, or technology upgrades.
Driving Assumptions
The driving assumptions behind this approach are:
1. Agencies already need some of the projected components/capabilities of   earlier, particularly, the web inspection capabilities and want them expedited;
2. Agencies can accommodate serial, increment releases within their own IT planning schedules;
3. It is generally desirable to show results to the users earlier;
4. Phased development may be somewhat less technology dependent in that new technology capabilities (e.g. a new .NET Framework or web development paradigm) can be accommodated as the project progresses and releases components;
5. Smaller, more focused releases may offer additional flexibility and responsiveness to user feedback;
6.   components are discrete and may be broken out into modular releases;
7. There may be less risk in modular releases, in that a change of direction/emphasis/schedule in response to external factors may be more possible;
8. Design reviews are less complicated and more easily accommodated in busy management schedules;
9. Smaller releases may map better into product revenue and contracting cycles;
10. Pontis 4.x will continue to provide significant BMS functionality for users until   capabilities are delivered; and
11. Pontis 4.x will continue to be maintained throughout the development period until all capabilities are delivered, but no significant interim releases are anticipated.

Key Deliverables
The key deliverables for this approach are:
 Design Documents: The system requirements and software design decisions will be documented in three design documents – one for each version of Pontis.
   Release: This version of Pontis will incorporate the core functionality of the software, as well as the functionality of the Inspection module, and it will be available no later than March 2007.
 Pontis 5.1 Release: This version of the software will incorporate the functionality of the Project Planning and Gateway modules, and it will be available no later than March 2008.
 Pontis 5.2 Release: This version of the software will incorporate the functionality of the Preservation, Programming, Configuration, and Results modules, and it will be available no later than April 2010.
Schedule
The tasks and schedule for this alternative are presented in Appendix B. The cost estimate is summarized in Section 6.6.
ALTERNATIVE 3 – DEDICATED DESIGN AND PHASED APPROACH
Overview
This alternative differs from Alternative 2 by emphasizing a dedicated design effort followed by phased development of   over time. The development does not start until the design is completed and approved. This alternative does emphasize significant prototyping efforts intended to ”prove out” and demonstrate design concepts, which serve to communicate key design concepts and shape expectations about the future product. There are multiple release cycles in this alternative, similar to Alternative 2.
Driving Assumptions
The driving assumptions behind this approach are:
1. A dedicated design effort allows for adequate user input and feedback prior to development;
2. As with Alternative 2, phased development may be somewhat less technology dependent in that new technology capabilities (e.g. a new .NET Framework or web development paradigm) can be accommodated as the project progresses and releases components;
3. A phased, multiple release, development process can be accommodated by agencies, as assumed in Alternative 2;
4. Revenue cycles are a driving factor, and all the development work must fit into current projections;
5. Pontis 4.x will continue to provide significant BMS functionality for users until   capabilities are delivered; and
6. Pontis 4.x will continue to be maintained throughout the development period until all capabilities are delivered, but no significant interim releases are anticipated.
Key Deliverables
 Prototypes: Three software prototypes will be developed and demonstrated
to the client as part of the software design.
 Design Document: The system requirements and software design decisions will be documented in a detailed design document .
   Release: This version of Pontis will incorporate the core functionality of the software, as well as the functionality of the Inspection module, and it will be available no later than June 2007.
 Pontis 5.1 Release: This version of the software will incorporate the functionality of the Project Planning and Gateway modules, and it will be available no later than June 2008.
 Pontis 5.2 Release: This version of the software will incorporate the functionality of the Preservation, Programming, Configuration, and Results modules, and it will be available no later than June 2010.
Schedule
The tasks and schedule for this alternative are presented in Appendix B. The cost estimate is summarized in Section 6.6.
6.6 RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVE
The expenditure by fiscal year for the three alternatives are presented in Table 6.2, and the delivery dates for each module are presented in Table 6.3.
   
  We recommend that AASHTO proceed with Alternative 3 (dedicated design and phased release). This project development strategy aligns well with available revenue cycles, allows a formal design review and adjustments, makes significant   components such as a web inspection module available relatively quickly after design is confirmed and approved. Further, this alternative provides positive feedback on user expectations, and allows adjustments to incorporate technology evolution during the development period.

 6.7 RISK ANALYSIS
The following are the major risks associated with the   development effort:
 Requirement Creep: There is a risk that system requirements will grow significantly beyond those conceived while developing the development cost estimate. This risk can be managed by developing a requirements document prior to starting the development effort.
 Obsolescence: There is a risk that the .NET standard will become obsolete during the product development cycle, or very soon after the new version of Pontis is released. This risk can be mitigated by adopting a phased approach to the design and/or the development effort.
 Development Cost: There is a risk that the actual cost of the development effort will significantly exceed the estimates.
 Development Schedule: There is a risk that the development effort will take significantly longer than scheduled. This may affect the license base if states decide to develop their own system or move to another system.
 Resource Risk: There is a risk that the developer will not have sufficient resources to complete the development, either because of staff turnover or because of a lack of technical expertise.
 Changes to the NBI: There is a risk that the changes to the NBI planned by the FHWA will significantly affect the development schedule or increase the cost of the development effort.
 Agency Custom Forms: There is a risk that the approach taken to providing agency forms will not support easy migration from Pontis 4.x to  .
 Maintaining Pontis 4.x: There is a risk that the cost to maintain Pontis 4.x will exceed budgeted amounts. This could happen if there are changes to PowerBuilder or Sybase that require major revisions to Pontis 4.x during the Pontis 5.x development cycle. This risk can be partially mitigated through a fixed price maintenance approach.
 User Satisfaction: There is a risk that the final product may not meet user expectations, either because it does not meet their requirements or because it does not conform to their technology standards. This risk can be managed through the use of prototypes in the design phase and by following a phased development schedule.

 7.0 Project Issues
7.1 OPEN ISSUES
There are no open issues as of this FRS version.
7.2 OFF-THE-SHELF SOLUTIONS
No review has been performed and consequently no commercial off-the-shelf solutions (COTS) have been identified as yet to fulfill special requirements in this document. Specific functionality in   may be provided by off-the-shelf solutions such as Sybase DataWindow .NET. COTS software may be in the public domain or licensed for a fee by AASHTO. Further COTS review will be conducted as part of the detailed design phase.
A standalone database engine will be required for off-line/standalone operation. It is assumed this will be the Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere product, release 9 or above.

    Appendix A – COSMIC-FFP Overview
In the COSMIC-FFP method, the software to be measured is broken down into “functional process types,” defined as “an elementary component of a set of Functional User Requirements (FUR) comprising a unique cohesive and independently executable set of data movement types.”
Figure A.1. Generic Flow of Data Attributes from a Functional Perspective35
Functional process types are broken down into four data movement types – Entry, Exit, Read, and Write. Each data movement is assumed to include certain data manipulations (e.g. data validation). Entries and Exits cross the boundary between the software being measured and its users (who may be any person or a different software layer or other piece of software). A Read moves data from
xa“persistent storage” into the software being measured, while a Write makes data “persistent,” meaning that the data lasts beyond the life of the functional process. Each instance of data movement equals one COSMIC Functional Size Unit (CFSU). The size of a functional process is the sum of its data movements, and the size of a piece of software is the sum of the sizes of all of its functional processes.
Measuring  
Purpose of Measurement
The purpose of measurement is to measure the size of FUR of   as they evolve as input to cost estimating and to the measurement of productivity.

Scope of Measurement
The scope of measurement is  , including work-output obtained by using existing re-usable code.

Measurement Viewpoint
The end-user measurement viewpoint allows a functional size to be measured of business application software as specified in the Functional User Requirement.
Figure A.2. Application Software Seen From the End User’s Perspective36

ring Mathematical Algorithms
COSMIC-FFP is not suited for measuring complex mathematical algorithms, which are a large, integral part of Pontis. To account for this limitation, the measurer is allowed to assign locally-determined functional size to the exceptional functionality.
Below is an example of COSMIC-FFP analysis on the Multimedia use case. The size of the Multimedia functionality is 29 CFSU.

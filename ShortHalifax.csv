The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) currently operates twelve (12) Halifax-class frigates and intends to operate them until their end of life, which is currently estimated to be 2036.  The HCCS EG is an integral component of the Halifax-class ships and will require ISS support until end of life for the Halifax-class. Of the twelve (12) Halifax-class frigates, seven (7) ships are assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic, located at Canadian Forces Base Halifax, Nova Scotia and five (5) ships are assigned to Maritime Forces Pacific, located at Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt, British Columbia. The Halifax-class frigates support the DND requirement to defend Canada and Canadian interests and contribute to international peace and security. 


The ships will be self-sufficient and able to participate and integrate into joint missions with the United States or multi-national forces anywhere in the world. The ships will be assigned tasks/missions to fulfill this requirement. 

The HCCS EG will support the ships in its conduct of these assigned tasks/missions. Ships are deployable, self-contained and capable of remaining on station for a prolonged period and will be capable of integrating into the larger Command and Control, Communication and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance capabilities provided at the joint or national levels.  In support of the missions, the HCCS EG will provide a situational awareness capability to provide for the coordination of activities and assets for open ocean and littoral operations. In accordance with the Naval Materiel Management System Manual (NaMMS), the Halifax-class makes use of Programmed Work Periods (PWPs).

Programmed Work Periods require repair facility support and are comprised of Short Work Periods (SWPs), Assisted Maintenance Periods (AMPs), Docking Work Periods / Interim Docking (DWPs) and Refit/Extended Docking Work Periods (EDWPs). The Contractor will be required to provide In-Service Support on the HCCS Equipment Group installed in all twelve (12) Halifax-class ships, RCN Fleet Schools, Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Scott (FMFCS), Fleet Maintenance Facility Cape Breton (FMFCB), and the Naval Electronic Systems Test Range Atlantic and Pacific (NESTRA, NESTRP).

Special Tools and Test Equipment (STTE) located at some of these sites will also require In- Service Support. HCCS EG first and second level maintenance will be the responsibility of DND, and third level maintenance will be provided by the Contractor.

However, the Contractor will have the capacity and capability to augment DND level one and two maintenance when requested, and conversely, DND may assist the Contractor to conduct level three maintenance. The Halifax-class ships are also supported by: a Halifax-class Design Agent and Support Services Contract, a Halifax-class Work Period Contract East (WPC-E), a Halifax- class Work Period Contract West (WPC-W), and the Combat Systems Integration (CSI) Contract.

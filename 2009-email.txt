Requirements Specification 
1. Enterprise E-mail Scope

Define the scope of the “Enterprise E-mail” project. (from F.S. 282.34 and Preliminary Scope Statement).
   282.34 Statewide e-mail system.--A state e-mail system that includes the service delivery and support for a statewide e-mail, messaging, and calendaring service is established as an enterprise information technology service as defined in s. 282.0041. The service shall be designed to meet the needs of all executive branch agencies and reduce the current cost of operation and support.
The product of this project will be a proposed plan for the establishment of the statewide electronic mail system. By December 31, 2009, the AEIT shall submit the proposed plan to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The plan shall be developed to reduce costs to the state and include, at a minimum:
a) An analysis of the in-house and external sourcing options that should be considered for delivery and support of the service. The analysis shall include an internally hosted system option, an externally sourced system option, and, if necessary, a combined in- house and externally sourced option.
b) A cost-benefit analysis that estimates all major cost elements associated with each sourcing option, including the nonrecurring and recurring costs of each option. The analysis must also include a comparison of the total cost of each enterprise e-mail sourcing option and the total cost of existing e-mail services in order to determine the level of savings that can be expected.
c) Estimated expenditures for each state agency associated with e-mail costs for the 2009-2010 fiscal year.
d) The plan must identify any existing e-mail infrastructure that should be considered for reuse.
e) A concise analysis of the ability of each sourcing option to meet major system requirements, including federal and state requirements for confidentiality, privacy, and security.
f) A complete description of the scope of functionality, operations, and required resources associated with each sourcing option.
g) Recommendations for standardizing the format of state e-mail addresses.
h) A reliable schedule for the decommission of all state agency e-mail systems and the migration of all agencies to the new system beginning by July 1, 2010, and completing by June 30, 2013.
 

2. Requirements Workgroup Methodology
 Define the process by which requirements were gathered and grouped as either “basic” or “extended”.
   The primary objective for the requirements workgroup was to gather all functional requirements for the state e-mail system (via excel spreadsheet) and compile all requirements into a complete, concise, and categorized functional requirements specification. The activities required to compile the requirements specification included reviewing the 2006 e-mail survey (and additional historical documentation), creating the 2009 e-mail survey, sending 2009 survey to agency e-mail (business) experts, compiling survey results into the formal requirements specification, and obtaining requirements approval from key stakeholders. Note: There are two subsequent surveys being sent out (to gather current agency inventory and financial information); the results of these two subsequent surveys are not included in this document.
The workgroup reviewed the 2006 survey (and other data sources such as schedule IV-C data and AEIT DCC questionnaire) and determined the list of categories and questions to be included in the survey. Agencies were asked to respond to each requirement question by selecting “currently have and use”, “do not have/do not use”, or “would like to have”. Agreed upon categories for the 2009 survey included E-mail, Calendar, & Contacts (user interface and administrative requirements); Archiving, Retention, Search, Discovery requirements; Disaster Recovery requirements, Backup & Restore requirements; Security, Anti-Virus, Filtering requirements; Remote Access & Mobile Messaging requirements; Additional E-mail requirements. The survey also provided a section for agencies to address their concerns/issues regarding a statewide e-mail system.
Upon receiving all survey responses, the workgroup determined which requirements should be recommended for inclusion in the “basic” and “extended” section of the functional requirements specification. Factors that were considered in the basic or extended decision included, % of agencies that currently provide, # of total users currently supported, and the legal necessity of fulfilling the requirement. The workgroup also identified whether the requirement will be a user, agency admin, or SSRC admin capability.
Once approval of this document is obtained from key stakeholders, these functional requirements will be used as an attachment in upcoming RFI’s and potential RFP’s (or ITN’s). An in house or externally sourced solution should meet the basic functional requirements specified in this document (or provide ample reasoning why a requirement is not technically or financially feasible).


3. Requirements Workgroup Goals
3.1
 Manage Scope: Understand the preliminary scope statement for the statewide e- mail system and ensure that requirements remain within scope.
3.2
 Manage Time: Specification must be complete within 6 weeks (30 business days).
3.3
 Manage Time: Workgroup will use the 2006 Messaging Optimization Workgroup Survey as a basis for the 2009 Enterprise e-mail survey.
3.4
 Ensure Completeness: Specification must be complete and detailed enough to submit to outside vendors as Request For Information (RFI) or Request For Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation to Negotiate (ITN).
3.5
 Ensure Completeness: Specification must include an attachment which provides a narrative and breakdown of existing agency resources (personnel, equipment – including storage capabilities, software-licenses) and current spend (reuse IV-C data where applicable) on e-mail. (Note: this information will be captured in the inventory survey which is being compiled by the Enterprise E-mail technical team – and is not included in this functional specification.)
3.6
 Ensure Completeness: Specification must include an attachment which lists each agencies’ risks, issues, or constraints (such as software-application dependencies, contracts, or legal requirements) that may affect their ability to transition to an Enterprise E-mail System. (Note: this information will be compiled into a FAQ document which will be posted to the project web site and made available to all stakeholders.)


4. Requirements Workgroup Glossary
4.1
 Basic requirements - The functional requirements that should be met as part of the “basic” (minimal) solution-offering (whether in house or outsourced). Note: all functional requirements will be subject to a technical and financial feasibility analysis.
4.2
 Extended requirements - The functional requirements that could be met as part of the “extended” solution offering (potentially at an additional cost to the customer). Note: all functional requirements will be subject to a technical and financial feasibility analysis.

9. Functional Requirements Summary
The functional requirements discovery and analysis process yielded the following results:
• Email, Calendar, and Contacts service category had a 97% “have and use” response average.
• Archiving, Retention, Discovery service category had a 66% “have and use” response average and a
     23% “would like to have” response average.
• Disaster Recovery service category had a 59% “have and use” response average and a 34% “would like
to have” response average.
• Backup & Restore service category had a 79% “have and use” response average and a 19% “would like
to have” response average.
• Security, Anti-Virus, Filtering service category had a 67% “have and use” response average and a 24%
“would like to have” response average.
• Remote Access, Mobile Messaging service category had a 71% “have and use” response average and
an 11% “would like to have” response average.
• Additional E-mail service category had a 48% “have and use” response average and a 26% “would like
to have” response average.
Based on these results, the majority of requirements for each category made it into the basic requirements recommendation. In each category except for email, calendar and contacts,
the survey showed that there is a potential need for extended services (varying service components, service levels, and costs). This is especially likely for the archiving, disaster recovery, security, and remote – mobile messaging categories. The survey also verified that more than half of agencies polled currently have and use a document collaboration and workflow application. However, in keeping within the scope of the statewide “e-mail, messaging, and calendaring” system proposal, it was agreed that collaboration services (such as shared documents and workflows, instant messaging, and discussion forums) should remain out of scope for this project. Finally, the technical and financial feasibility of each functional requirement will be further evaluated by the Enterprise E-mail technical and financial workgroups prior to submitting the proposed plan for statewide e-mail by December 31, 2009.
